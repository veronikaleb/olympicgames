                <p>The first known Olympics were held in the summer of 776 B.C. at Olympia, a site in southern Greece 
                where people went to worship their gods. In fact, the Olympics were created in honor of ancient Greece’s 
                most famous god: Zeus, king of the gods. Athletes prayed to Zeus for victory and left gifts to thank 
                him for their successes.</p>

            <p>A number of initiatives to re-establish an international sporting event were attempted at the end of the 19th century, 
            but failed due to the lack of coordination among the worldwide sporting movement – until one man decided to bring
            the main stakeholders together in Paris. The Olympic Games were therefore revived at the first Olympic Congress, 
            organised by Baron Pierre de Coubertin and held at the Grand Amphitheatre at the Sorbonne University from 16 to 23 June 1894.
            Two thousand people attended, including 58 French delegates representing 24 sports organisations and clubs, and 20 delegates
            from Belgium, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Russia, Spain, Sweden and the United States representing 13 foreign 
            sports federations.</p><br>

        <section class="text_history text_history2">
            <p>The first Olympic Games of the modern era took place in Athens, in the country where the original Games took place
            in Antiquity, in April 1896. Paris hosted the second Games in 1900.</p><br>
            <p>The Paris 1900 Olympic Games saw women compete for the first time. The first female Olympic champion was
            Charlotte Cooper, a British tennis player who won Wimbledon five times. Out of a total of 997 athletes, 22 were women,
            competing in just five sports: tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrian events and golf. Of these disciplines, only golf 
            and tennis included women‑only events. According to the Olympic Charter, the IOC’s role is “to encourage and support
            the promotion of women in sport at all levels and in all structures, with a view to implementing the principle
            of equality of men and women”. Female participation in the Olympic Games has increased dramatically since; 
            48.9% of the athletes at the 2020 Tokyo Games are expected to be women, as opposed to 23% at the 1984 
            Los Angeles Games and just 13% at the 1964 Tokyo Games. The IOC has been working with international
            federations as well as the Olympic Games Organising Committees to increase the number of women’s events
            at the Games for over 20 years. By adding a women’s boxing event, the Games in London in 2012 were
            the first where women competed in all sports of the Olympic programme. At the Olympic Games in Rio in 2016,
            45% (5,059 women out of a total of 11,238) of the athletes were women. The Games of Tokyo in 2021 were
            the most equal yet, with 48.9% women athletes.</p>

          <h2>Garmisch-Partenhircken and Berlin 1936 Olympics</h2>
         <p>The Winter and Summer Olympic Games took place in Germany, in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Berlin respectively.
           For the first time, the spectacle of the opening ceremony was broadcast live — an incredible development. 
           Between big screens set up in Germany and the few households owning television sets, around 150,000 viewers 
           tuned in. However, the Games served as a propaganda tool for Nazi Germany; the epitome of this was Leni Riefenstahl’s 
           documentary film of the Games in Berlin, Olympia, which served as a monument to Nazism. It was also at the Berlin Games in 1936 that
            the Olympic flame was introduced for the first time.</p>

          <h2>Lillehammer 1994 Winter Olympics</h2>
          <p>The Winter Games were held in Lillehammer , just two years after the last Winter Games in Albertville, in 1992. 
          This adjustment was made so that the Winter Games would no longer be held in the same year as the Summer Olympics,
           which take place in the first year of each Olympiad.</p>

            <p>At the Olympic Games in Sydney, North and South Korea marched together under the same flag at the opening ceremony.
               This was an unprecedented symbol of peace since diplomatic relations between the two states had ended after the Korean 
               War of 1950 to 1953.</p>

              <h2>The Olympic Games Today</h2>
                <p>Olympism is defined by its universality, as demonstrated by its continuous development and worldwide presence
                   on every habitable continent. There are 206 NOCs in the IOC, compared to the 193 member states of the UN for example.
                    This universality gives unparalleled reach to the movement’s ongoing efforts to promote people and education.</p>

            <h2>History of the Paralympics</h2>
            <p>The Paralympic Games have a more recent history, beginning in 1948. The movement was initiated by Dr. Ludwig Guttmann,
            a German neurologist, who organized a sports competition for World War II veterans with spinal cord injuries at the 
            Stoke Mandeville Hospital in England. This event, known as the Stoke Mandeville Games, is considered the precursor
            to the Paralympics.</p><br>
            <p>The first official Paralympic Games were held in 1960 in Rome, Italy, featuring 400 athletes from 23 countries.
            These games were held shortly after the Olympic Games and included sports such as wheelchair basketball, para 
            athletics, and para swimming23. The Winter Paralympics were introduced in 1976 in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden.</p>
            <p>Since 1988, the Paralympics have been held in the same cities and venues as the Olympics, thanks to an agreement
            between the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The Paralympics
            have grown to include a wide range of sports and athletes with various disabilities, promoting inclusivity and 
            the spirit of competition.</p><br>
