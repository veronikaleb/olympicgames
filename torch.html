          A modern invention inspired by practices from ancient Greece, the Olympic Torch Relay heralds the start
           of the Olympic Games and transmits a message of peace and friendship along its route.

        <p>The Olympic flame is a symbol used in the Olympic movement. It is also a symbol of continuity between ancient and
           modern games. The Olympic flame is lit at Olympia, Greece, several months before the Olympic Games. This ceremony
            starts the Olympic torch relay, which formally ends with the lighting of the Olympic cauldron during the opening 
            ceremony of the Olympic Games. Through 2022, the flame would continue to burn in the cauldron for the duration
             of the Games, until it was extinguished during the Olympic closing ceremony. In 2024, electric lighting and 
             mist were used to create a simulated flame for the Olympic cauldron, with the actual flame kept in a lantern
              exhibited at an adjacent location. That lantern was then taken by French swimmer Léon Marchand from Jardins
               des Tuileries (where the Olympic cauldron, that was extinguished at that moment, was located) and ceremonially
                "transferred" to the Stade de France at the start of the Closing Ceremony: there it was finally extinguished
                 just after the IOC president declared officially closed the Games.</p><br>
        <p class="torch_background"><b>First used at the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics, the modern torches of the Summer and Winter Olympics are
           built to resist the effects of wind and rain as they carry the Olympic flame, and bear unique designs 
           that represent the host country and the spirit of the Games.</b></p><br>

        <p>Although in the past some Olympic organizing committees organized torch relays which encompassed multiple countries,
           the International Olympic Committee now restricts international relays due to the protests during the 2008 Summer Olympics
            torch relay, in which the relay was met with protests at several international sites on its way to Beijing.</p><br>
