            <p>The fight against doping is a real team effort—one that lasts before, during and after the Games.
               All the stakeholders help to ensure the integrity of competition and protect the health of the athletes.
               Athletes, spectators, organisers, sponsors—everyone expects a fair competition. In addition to skewing
                the results, many forbidden substances and methods represent a health risk for the athletes.
                 Anti-doping measures must protect the physical and mental health of the athletes while defending
                  the values championed by sport and competition: ethics, perseverance and excelling.</p><br>

          <p>The Olympic and Paralympic Games put an anti-doping programme in place in the 1960s. Since then, the International
             Olympic Committee (IOC) and International Paralympic Committee (IPC) have set out the anti-doping rules
              for the Games in line with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Code.</p><br>

        <h2 align="center">Russian Doping Scandal</h2><br>
        <p>The Russian doping scandal came to light in 2015 when a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)
           revealed widespread, state-sponsored doping in Russia. This led to the suspension of the Russian Anti-Doping 
           Agency (RUSADA) and the banning of many Russian athletes from international competitions.</p><br> 
        <p>Due to the doping scandal, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) imposed several sanctions on Russia:</p><br>
          <ul>
          <li><b>2016 Rio Olympics:</b> Many Russian athletes were banned from competing,
             particularly in track and field events.</li><br>
          <li><b>2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics:</b> Russia was banned from competing as a nation.
             However, some athletes were allowed to compete under the designation “Olympic Athletes from Russia”
              (OAR) if they could prove they were clean.</li><br>
          <li><b>2020 Tokyo Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics:</b> Russia was again banned from competing under 
            its flag. Athletes competed under the name “Russian Olympic Committee” (ROC).</li><br>
          </ul>
        </section>
    <section class="text_history">
      <h2 align="center">Anti-Doping Measures</h2><br>
        <ul>
        <li><b>1967:</b> The International Olympic Committee (IOC) began banning performance-enhancing drugs.</li><br>
        <li><b>1999:</b> The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was established to coordinate global anti-doping efforts.</li><br>
        <li><b>2016:</b> The IOC delegated anti-doping rule violations to an independent body, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).</li><br>
        </ul>

    <p>Alongside the anti-doping control operations, Paris 2024 will provide the athletes with a range of educational materials.
       Each doping control station will feature posters and tools to share information on anti-doping regulations and rights.
        Paris 2024 is also building awareness of the fight against doping among all its volunteers through a dedicated module
         as part of their training. Lastly, Paris 2024 is setting out its commitment to younger generations by sharing content
          with French educational staff through its Generation 2024 platform. The aim is to actively help develop a shared 
          culture for clean sport.</p><br>
