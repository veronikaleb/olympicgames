          <section class="text_history">
              <p>The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) is the global governing body of the Paralympic Movement and is based in Bonn, Germany.
                Founded on 22 September 1989 as a non-profit organisation, we aim to be athlete-centred and membership-focussed in all our endeavours.
                Working with our 200 plus member organisations, we use Para sport as a vehicle to advance the lives of the world’s 1.2 billion persons with disabilities.
                The work of the Paralympic Movement has a transformational impact on society. A strong belief that Change Starts with Sport motivates our international 
                workforce to work as one team, aligned and focussed on fulfilling our vision and mission through delivery of the IPC Strategic Plan.</p><br>

          <h2>International Federations</h2>
          </section>
          <section class="text_history">
              <p>International Federations (IFs) play a crucial role in the governance of sports, particularly
                 in the context of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. These organizations are responsible for overseeing 
                 the global development and regulation of their respective sports, ensuring that they are played fairly,
                  safely, and according to standardized rules.</p><br>
                  <p>In the Olympic Games, International Federations are the cornerstone of the organization and conduct of the 
                    competitions. Each sport featured in the Olympics is governed by its own IF, which sets the rules, organizes 
                    competitions, and ensures that the athletes adhere to the highest standards of integrity and sportsmanship.
                    For instance, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), now known as World Athletics,
                    governs track and field events, while the International Swimming Federation (FINA) oversees swimming competitions.
                    These federations are responsible for certifying that athletes and competitions meet the Olympic standards and for 
                    organizing qualification events that determine which athletes and teams will participate in the Games.</p><br>
                    <p>Similarly, in the Paralympic Games, International Federations are essential to the organization and
                     management of sports for athletes with disabilities. Each Paralympic sport has its own IF, which ensures
                     that the sport is accessible and inclusive while maintaining high standards of competition.
                     For example, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) serves as the IF for several sports, 
                     including athletics, swimming, and powerlifting. Other sports, like wheelchair basketball, 
                     are governed by their respective federations, such as the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF).</p>

                <p>The IOC entrusts the organization of the Olympic Games to the NOC of the host country. The local NOC
                   forms an OCOG to accomplish the task of organizing the Olympic Games for a given year. OCOGs must 
                   comply with three sources of authority: the Olympic Charter; the contract entered into between the IOC,
                    the NOC of the host country, and the host city; and the instructions from the IOC Executive Board.</p><br> 
                  <p>The Winter and Summer games alternate every two years. The OCOGs currently operating are <b>Paris 2024 (Summer), 
                  Milano Cortina 2026 (Winter), Dakar 2026 (Summer Youth Olympics), Los Angeles 2028 (Summer), French Alps 2030 (Winter),
